Problem Statement
Build a Smart Airport Ride Pooling Backend System that groups passengers into shared
cabs while optimizing routes and pricing.

Functional Requirements
• Group passengers into shared cabs.
• Respect luggage and seat constraints.
• Minimize total travel deviation.
• Ensure no passenger exceeds detour tolerance.
• Handle real-time cancellations.
• Support 10,000 concurrent users.
• Handle 100 requests per second.
• Maintain latency under 300ms.

Expected Deliverables
• DSA approach with complexity analysis.
• Low Level Design (class diagram + patterns used).
• High Level Architecture diagram.
• Concurrency handling strategy.
• Database schema and indexing strategy.
• Dynamic pricing formula design.

EXECUTION GUIDE

Mandatory Implementation Requirement
• You MUST implement working backend code. Design-only submissions will not be
accepted.
• The system must be runnable locally.
• All required APIs must be fully implemented.
• Concurrency handling must be demonstrated in code.
• Database schema must be implemented with migrations or setup scripts.

Submission Instructions
• Push complete working code to a Git repository.
• Include a detailed README with setup and run instructions.
• Provide API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI/Postman).
• Mention tech stack and assumptions clearly.
• Include sample test data.
• Document algorithm complexity where applicable.

Evaluation Focus
• Correctness of implementation.
• Database modeling and indexing.
• Concurrency safety.
• Performance considerations.
• Clean architecture and modularity.
• Testability and maintainability.
